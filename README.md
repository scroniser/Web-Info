# Resources #

<p>Welcome to my personal list of resources. You'll find most everything in the wiki file.</p>

<p>When something I've downloaded doesn't have a link (due to a wide variety of reasons), I'll probably throw it as a file into this repo.</p>

<p>Any files contained in this repo should be considered property of the original creator and/or author. These resources are strictly for my own reference, though others may use them as appropriate.</p>
